# dream-programming-language

This is the repository for my unnamed dream programming language.

# context

I am a backend and devops engineer. I usually reach for Python to develop small programs to see how to implement something, then Java for multithreaded programs and C or Java for my own programming language implementation projects. I wrote the beginnings of a amd64 JIT compiler in C at https://github.com/samsquire/compiler.

# goals

* a language that abstracts implementation details from architectural details
* a language that represents behaviours as a first class citizen
* a language that has a common behavioural debugging system

# behavioural debugging

State gets in the way of behaviours.
